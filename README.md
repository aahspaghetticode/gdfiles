# Files to the Google Doodle Gnome game! Example at http://gnome.codespaget.org/
I did it again! To deploy, navigate to the folder with page.html and run python3 -m http.server 8000. (Only tested on Ubuntu) From there, go to http://localhost:8000/page.html and you are playing the gnome game offline! I always play this game in school as Google.com is never blocked (obviously,) and now you can play it offline!
# ***You cannot just open page.html due to CORS restrictions!***
Also, note that the game zooms out when you press play. I tried to fix this but failed, no idea why it does this.
